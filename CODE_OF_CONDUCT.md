# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We aim to create an inclusive and harassment-free environment where everyone feels welcome to participate, collaborate, and contribute.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming language;
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences;
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism;
* Focusing on what is best for the community; and
* Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks;
* Public or private harassment;
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission; and
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at team@pinto.money. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
